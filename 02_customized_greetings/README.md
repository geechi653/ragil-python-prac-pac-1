## Description
In this exercise you will practice customizing the output of the print() function.

## Instructions
1. Print on one line the words "Good Morning", "Python", and "Programmers" separated by a dash (-) and ending with three exclamation marks.
2. On a new line, print using an f-string: Hello, my name is Alice and I love Python.

## Expected Output In Terminal:
```text
Good Morning-Python-Programmers!!! 
Hello, my name is Alice and I love Python.
```

#### Hint:
It is up to your interpretation how to solve this problem. You could experiment with `sep` and `end` arguments in print() method.

Also, the name Alice and Python in second sentence, could be hard coded or used from a variable. 

Suggestion: try to experiment with different approaches.
