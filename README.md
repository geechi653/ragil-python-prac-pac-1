# Python Practice - Part 1

Welcome to this Python practice package! This collection contains 15 carefully designed exercises to help you strengthen your Python fundamentals.

## Topics Covered

- Basic printing and comments
- Variables and value assignment
- Data types (strings, integers, floats, booleans, None)
- String manipulation and formatting
- Math operations and the math module
- Random number generation with the random module
- Arithmetic operators and operator precedence

## Exercise Structure

Each exercise folder contains:
- A README.md with instructions
- A solution.py file where you'll write your code
- A test_solution.py file to verify your solution

## How to Use This Package

### With CodeDrills Extension (Recommended)

This package is designed to work seamlessly with the CodeDrills extension, which provides:
- Instant feedback on your solutions
- Progress tracking
- Easy test execution
- Report generation for submission

To get started with CodeDrills:
1. Install the CodeDrills extension for your IDE
2. Open the exercise you want to work on
3. Read the instructions in the README.md
4. Write your solution in solution.py
5. Use CodeDrills to test your solution
6. Generate a report when you're done with all exercises

### Without CodeDrills

If you're not using CodeDrills, you can still complete the exercises:
1. Navigate to the exercise directory
2. Read the README.md for instructions
3. Edit the solution.py file
4. Run tests manually with pytest:
   ```
   pytest test_solution.py -v
   ```
