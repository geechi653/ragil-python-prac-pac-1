# 11_randomizer_challenge

## Description
In this exercise you will use the random module to generate random values.
Remember to start working with random object you first need to import it. 

## Instructions  
1. Print a random float between 0 and 1.  
2. Print a random integer between 1 and 50.  
3. Print a random choice from the list `["red", "blue", "green", "black", "yellow"]`.  
4. Shuffle the list `["apple", "banana", "plum", "orange"]` and print it.

## Expected console output can be different in your case since it is randomized:
```text
0.2038849
5
black
[orange, banana, plum, apple]
```

### Since the output is random, the tests will validate that:
1. The first output is a float between 0 and 1.  
2. The second output is an integer between 1 and 50.  
3. The third output is one of the colors: `red`, `blue`, `green`, `black`, `yellow`.  
4. The fourth output is a shuffled list of fruits: `["apple", "banana", "plum", "orange"]`.
