# 07_type_detective

## Description
In this exercise you will create variables of different types and print them along with their types. Also, demonstrate the floating-point precision issue.

## Instructions 
1. Create and print an integer, a float, a complex number, and a boolean along with their types.  
2. Print the result of the expression `0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3` with an appropriate message.

## Expected console output
```text
100 <class 'int'>
3.14 <class 'float'>  
(3+4j) <class 'complex'>
True <class 'bool'>
0.1 + 0.2 == 0.3: False
```
