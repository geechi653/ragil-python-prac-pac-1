## Description  
In this exercise you will practice dynamic typing in Python.

## Instructions
1. Create a variable (e.g. `data`) and assign it an integer (e.g., `100`), then print its value and type.  
2. Reassign it to a string (e.g., `"Hello"`) and print its value and type.  
3. Reassign it to a boolean (`True`) and print its value and type.


## Expected console output
```text
100 <class 'int'>
Hello <class 'str'>
True <class 'bool'>
```
